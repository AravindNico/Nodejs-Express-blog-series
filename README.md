# Nodejs-Express-blog-series

You might wonder why I’m writing a Node.js tutorial blog which is already available in plenty.There’s no shortage of Node.js tutorials out there, but most of them cover specific use cases or topics that only apply when you’ve already got Node up and running. As a beginner, I’ve learned about Node.js that I thought I’d share. Nothing in here is hard, and you’ve got a fighting chance of getting this right on your own with no help from me, but I did learn a few things the hard way and felt I should share them.

Let me introduce myself first. I’m Aravind, IoT Application developer and I’m completely new to this Node.js world, I started with Node.js for creating a dashboard application which provides monitoring of sensor data and data visualization. When I started, I found lots of information about Node.js, but it can be difficult for beginners to find good, step-by-step information on how to get started. So I planned to compile all my study works into a blog series where it will be useful for any beginners to kickstart with Node.js to build a complete web application step by step.

## This tutorial series covers:
    1.Getting started with Node.js
    2.Getting started with Express.js
    3.How to make AJAX requests using node / express.js
    4.Simple Express application with Cassandra database along with session handling.
    5.Creating REST API using node / express.js with Cassandra database.
    6.Node / express.js application over HTTPS
    7.Node application with NGINX

This tutorial series answers the questions that can bog down a typical newbie developer and explains how to get started from the very beginning.
