This module uses datastax [dse-driver](https://github.com/datastax/nodejs-driver-dse) which is based on the official [cassandra-driver](https://github.com/datastax/nodejs-driver) for node. The dse driver is used so that both apache-cassandra and datastax enterprise users can use this module. Some of the base orm features are wrapper over a highly modified version of [apollo-cassandra](https://github.com/3logic/apollo-cassandra) module. The modifications made to the orm library was necessary to support missing features in the orm, keep it updated with the latest cassandra releases and to make it compatible with the advanced requirements of this module.
